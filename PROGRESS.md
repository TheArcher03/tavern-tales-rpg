# Progress Log

Read this file first in any new session before doing more work — it's the
single source of truth for what's done and what's next.

## Status: Stage 3 complete — core UI shell
Date: 2026-08-19

## Tech stack (decided)
- **Client**: Vite + React + TypeScript (`client/`)
- **Server**: Node + Express + TypeScript, run via `tsx` in dev (`server/`)
  — holds the future `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and will make Claude API calls
  server-side so the key never reaches the browser
- **Monorepo**: npm workspaces (root `package.json` lists `client` and
  `server` as workspaces); `concurrently` runs both dev servers with one
  command
- **Persistence**: deferred. No DB yet — Stage 8 (save/load) will likely
  start with browser `localStorage` plus JSON export/import, since this is
  a single-player game with no multi-device sync requirement. Revisit only
  if that turns out to be insufficient.
- **Shared code**: a third workspace, `shared/` (`@tavern-tales/shared`),
  holds game-rule types and pure logic that both `client` and `server` will
  need (character data model now; DM tool-call schemas later). It exports
  raw `.ts` directly (no build step required in dev) — `tsx` (server) and
  Vite (client) both transpile workspace-linked TS on the fly. `npm run
  build -w shared` still exists for a real `dist/` when needed.
- No test framework added for `client`/`server` yet, but `shared` uses
  Node's built-in `node:test` + `node:assert` (run via `tsx --test`) since
  it's pure logic worth protecting with unit tests, and this needed no new
  dependency. Revisit with a real framework (Vitest, etc.) if UI or server
  logic later needs component/integration tests.

## What's built
- `client/` — Vite React TS app scaffolded via `npm create vite@latest`,
  trimmed of template boilerplate (demo counter, logos, docs links). Vite
  dev server proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:3001` (`client/vite.config.ts`)
  so the browser can call the backend with a relative path in both dev and
  prod (behind a reverse proxy later).
- `server/` — minimal Express app (`server/src/index.ts`) with one route,
  `GET /api/hello`, returning `{ message: "Hello from the Dungeon Master." }`.
  `server/.env.example` documents `PORT` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (the real
  `.env` is gitignored and not created yet — no key is wired up).
- Root `package.json` — npm workspaces for `client` + `server`, with
  `npm run dev` (both servers concurrently) and `npm run build`.
- Verified end to end: `npm install` at root, `npm run dev`, confirmed
  `GET /api/hello` responds directly on :3001 and through the Vite proxy on
  :5173, and confirmed in-browser that the React page fetches and renders
  "Hello from the Dungeon Master." from the Express server.
- Node.js was not installed on this machine at the start of this session;
  installed via `nvm` (v24.19.0 LTS) since there was no Homebrew either.
  `nvm` init lines were added to `~/.zshrc`.

## What's built (Stage 2)
All in `shared/src/`, exported from `shared/src/index.ts`:
- `abilities.ts` — `AbilityName`/`AbilityScores` types, `abilityModifier`
  (SRD floor((score-10)/2)), `proficiencyBonusForLevel` (+2 at level 1,
  +1 every 4 levels).
- `pointBuy.ts` — SRD standard 27-point buy: cost table for scores 8-15,
  `pointBuyCost`, and `validatePointBuy` (returns valid/pointsUsed/
  pointsRemaining/errors — used by `createCharacter` and reusable later by
  a character-creation UI for live feedback as the player allocates points).
- `race.ts`, `characterClass.ts`, `background.ts` — data-driven types
  (`Race`, `CharacterClass`, `Background`) each with a small starter seed
  array (4 races: Human/Elf/Dwarf/Halfling; 4 classes: Fighter/Wizard/
  Rogue/Cleric; 4 backgrounds: Acolyte/Soldier/Criminal/Sage) and a
  `get*(id)` lookup that throws on an unknown id. Deliberately not the full
  SRD catalog (13 classes, 9 races, 13 backgrounds) — more can be added
  incrementally without touching any other code, since everything reads
  from these arrays.
- `character.ts` — the `Character` interface (id, name, race/class/
  background ids, level, base + final ability scores, ability modifiers,
  proficiency bonus, hit points, armor class) and `createCharacter(input)`,
  a pure factory that validates the point-buy allocation, applies racial
  ability increases, and derives HP (class hit die + CON modifier) and AC
  (10 + DEX modifier) for a level-1 character. Throws on invalid input
  (bad point-buy spend, unknown race/class/background id) rather than
  silently coercing, since a DM tool-call handler downstream needs to
  reject bad state changes loudly, not guess.
- 14 unit tests across `abilities.test.ts`, `pointBuy.test.ts`,
  `character.test.ts` (`npm run test -w shared`, or `npm test` from root) —
  all passing. `npm run typecheck -w shared` and root `npm run build` also
  verified clean.
- Not wired into `client` or `server` yet — no UI or API route imports
  `@tavern-tales/shared` yet. That starts in Stage 3 (character creation
  screen) and later in the DM tool-calling layer.

## What's built (Stage 3)
`client` now depends on `@tavern-tales/shared` (`"@tavern-tales/shared": "*"`
in `client/package.json`, resolved via the npm workspace symlink — no build
step needed since Vite transpiles the linked TS source directly).

- `features/characterCreation/` — `CharacterCreationForm.tsx` (name input,
  race/class/background `<select>`s populated straight from `RACES`/
  `CHARACTER_CLASSES`/`BACKGROUNDS`) and `AbilityScoreAllocator.tsx` (a
  +/− stepper per ability). The allocator disables `+` the moment the next
  increment would exceed the 27-point budget and disables `−` at the
  minimum score of 8, so an invalid allocation is impossible to reach
  through the UI — `validatePointBuy` (for the live "points remaining"
  readout) and `createCharacter` (on submit) are the only calls into
  `shared` here. Submit is disabled until a name is entered and the
  allocation is valid; a thrown error from `createCharacter` (e.g. unknown
  id) surfaces as inline form text rather than crashing the app.
- `features/story/` — `StoryShell.tsx` composes `CharacterSheet.tsx`
  (name, race/class/background, HP/AC/proficiency bonus, all six ability
  scores + modifiers — reads straight off the `Character` object plus
  `getRace`/`getCharacterClass`/`getBackground` for display names),
  `StoryLog.tsx` (scrolling transcript), `ChoiceButtons.tsx` (renders a
  list of suggested strings), and `FreeTextInput.tsx` (text box + submit).
  There's no DM yet — choosing a suggested choice or submitting free text
  both just append a `player`-speaker entry to the log via one shared
  `recordPlayerAction` callback, with a static intro line saying the DM
  isn't connected. This is intentionally just wiring, not narrative logic;
  that's Stage 4.
- `App.tsx` holds `character: Character | null` in `useState` and switches
  between `CharacterCreationForm` and `StoryShell` — no router or context
  needed for two screens and this little prop-drilling.
- Verified manually end to end in-browser: built a Human Fighter (STR 15
  point-bought, remaining stats at 8) — confirmed the allocator blocked
  over-budget and sub-minimum clicks, confirmed the character sheet showed
  the correct derived values (STR 16 after the human +1, HP 9 = fighter
  d10 + CON mod −1, AC 9 = 10 + DEX mod −1, proficiency +2), then clicked a
  suggested choice and submitted free text and confirmed both landed in the
  log in order.
- `npm run build` (all three workspaces) and `npm run test -w shared`
  (still 14/14) both pass.

## Next up (Stage 4): LLM Dungeon Master integration
- Wire the server to actually call the Claude API: needs a real
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `server/.env` (gitignored, never commit it) and
  probably the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package added to `server/package.json`.
- Design the DM's tool-calling contract: what structured tools it can call
  to change game state (the README's core design goal — narrate freely,
  but mutate state only through defined tools so the DM can't contradict
  itself). This will likely define its own types in `shared/` alongside
  the `Character` model, e.g. a `DMTurnRequest`/`DMTurnResponse` shape and
  a set of tool schemas (deal damage, adjust alignment, advance the scene).
- Replace `StoryShell`'s local `recordPlayerAction`-only flow with a real
  round-trip: player action → POST to a new server route → Claude call
  with the character + story-so-far as context → narrated response (+ any
  tool calls) → append to the log and apply state changes to the character.
- The static `PLACEHOLDER_CHOICES` in `StoryShell.tsx` and the intro line
  saying "the Dungeon Master is not connected" both need to go once the
  real DM is generating suggested choices and opening narration itself.
- The `/api/hello` route from Stage 1 can be deleted once a real DM route
  exists, or left as a harmless health check — no strong reason either way.
- Not yet needed: combat resolution, leveling, alignment tracking,
  persistence — those are later stages; Stage 4 is specifically about
  getting one narrated round-trip working.

## Notes for future sessions / continuity
- This file should be updated at the end of every work session with what
  changed and what the immediate next step is, so a fresh session (or a
  fresh Claude instance) can pick up without needing prior chat history.
- To run the app: `npm install` at the repo root, then `npm run dev`
  (client on :5173, server on :3001).
